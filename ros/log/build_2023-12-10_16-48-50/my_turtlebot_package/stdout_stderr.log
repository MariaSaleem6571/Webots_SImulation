CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros2_navigation.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros2_navigation", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros2_navigation"
  with any of the following names:

    ros2_navigationConfig.cmake
    ros2_navigation-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros2_navigation" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ros2_navigation_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ros2_navigation" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
